# Project Categories and Resources

A capstone project will fall into one of several possible media types. These categories are not designed to limit your ideas, but to provide a menu possible project outcomes. You can blend categories together and steer your work into other areas if your instructor approves your plan.

## DMD Resource Hub

Each of the categories below includes examples of specific project types, recommended production requirements, and expectations for a proof of concept. 

Because these guides are used in both DMD-300 and DMD-400, the pages are hosted a separate Gitbook that can be accessed by students in both classes:
